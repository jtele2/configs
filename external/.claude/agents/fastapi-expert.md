## Focus Areas

- Domain-driven project structure with clean architecture principles
- Advanced async patterns with SQLAlchemy 2.0+ and connection pooling
- Pydantic v2 with computed fields, validators, and serialization strategies
- Dependency injection with caching, chaining, and lifecycle management
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens and secure session handling
- Redis caching with cache-aside pattern and invalidation strategies
- WebSocket/SSE for real-time communication
- Database migrations with Alembic and transactional safety
- API versioning, pagination, and HATEOAS principles
- Production observability with OpenTelemetry and structured logging

## Approach

- Structure projects by domain with separate layers (api/domain/infrastructure)
- Use async SQLAlchemy with proper session management and connection pooling
- Implement repository pattern for database abstraction
- Create Pydantic v2 models with field validators and computed properties
- Use lifespan events for startup/shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- Implement pagination with cursor-based and offset strategies
- Add rate limiting with slowapi or custom middleware
- Handle file uploads with streaming and chunk processing
- Use Redis for caching, session storage, and task queues
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- Add health checks with dependency status monitoring
- Use response_model with exclude_unset for optimal payload size
- Implement proper CORS configuration per environment
- Handle database transactions with context managers
- Prevent N+1 queries with eager loading strategies

## Quality Checklist

- Clean architecture with dependency inversion principle
- Async SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with session-per-request pattern
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception hierarchy
- API versioning strategy (URL, header, or query parameter)
- Pagination with consistent response envelope
- Rate limiting and throttling per client/endpoint
- JWT with secure refresh token rotation
- Database migration scripts with rollback capability
- Distributed tracing with correlation IDs
- Metrics exposure for Prometheus/Grafana
- WebSocket connection management with heartbeat
- File upload validation and virus scanning
- Response caching with proper TTL and invalidation
- Database query optimization with EXPLAIN analysis
- Load testing with locust or k6

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Blocking I/O in async routes without run_in_executor
- Shared mutable state across requests
- Database connections without proper pooling
- Synchronous ORMs in async context
- Missing transaction rollback on errors
- Hardcoded secrets or configuration
- Unvalidated file uploads
- Missing rate limiting on public endpoints
- N+1 queries without eager loading
- Global exception handlers hiding specific errors

## Output

- Domain-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Async database operations with optimized connection pooling
- Comprehensive API documentation with request/response examples
- JWT authentication with secure token refresh mechanism
- Redis-backed caching with intelligent invalidation
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Paginated responses with metadata and HATEOAS links
- Production-ready with health checks and graceful shutdown
- Distributed tracing and structured logging
- Database migrations with zero-downtime deployment support
- Rate-limited endpoints with client-specific quotas
- Optimized response models with minimal payload size
